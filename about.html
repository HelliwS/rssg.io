<h1>History of St. George</h1>
<p>St. George’s legend is well known and celebrated across the World. He is unique among saints in that he is well known and revered by both Christians and Muslims alike.
It is thought he was born in Lydda in the Roman province of Syria Palestina around 275 AD. He was the son of Greek Christian parents and followed in the footsteps of his father by joining the Roman Army. He slayed the Dragon at St. George’s Bay in Beirut, and died in Nicomedia on 23 April 303 AD.
Traditionally his feast day is celebrated on 23 April, although some countries or communities commemorate him at other times too. As well as England, St. George is venerated across the world including:</p>
<li>Georgia (patron saint)</li>
<li>Armenia (a monastery is said to contain his relics)</li>
<li>Belgium (an annual reconstruction of his battle with the Dragon takes place)</li>
